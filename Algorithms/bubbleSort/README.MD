# Bubble Sort (Descending Order)

**Bubble Sort** is a fundamental sorting algorithm based on repeated comparison and swapping of adjacent elements.  
This implementation sorts an array in **descending order** using JavaScript.

## Features

- Sorts numeric arrays in **descending** order
- Simple, readable two-loop structure
- Demonstrates classic **bubble sort** logic
- Logs the sorted array to the console

## How It Works

The `bubbleSort` function compares adjacent elements and swaps them if the left one is **smaller** than the right one.  
Each iteration "bubbles" the largest unsorted value to the front.

## Function example
    array = bubbleSort([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]);
## Output
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

## Run
    node bubblesort.js
--You can run this code in any browser console or JavaScript runtime 

## Educational Notes
1. Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) in worst and average case

2. In-place sorting, no extra memory

3. Great for learning, but inefficient for large datasets
